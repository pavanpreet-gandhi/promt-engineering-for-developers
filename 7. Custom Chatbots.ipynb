    "So far we have been using the **OpenAI Chat API** to take in a single prompt from a user and return a model generated message. For many tasks, this itself is quite useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the Chat API is also designed to be able to **take in a list of messages** and return a model-generated message. Each message has a `role` and `content`. The content contains some text, and the role can be one of the following:\n",
    "- `assistant`: the chatbot \n",
    "- `user`: the person interacting with the chatbot\n",
    "- `system`: sets the behaviour and personality of the chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, a conversation is formatted with a system message first, followed by alternating user and assistant messages. The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user messages help instruct the assistant. They can be generated by the end users of an application, or set by a developer as an instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assistant messages help store prior responses. They can also be written by a developer to help give examples of desired behavior.\n",

    "**Note:** ChatGPT (a chatbot built ontop of `gpt-3.5-turbo`) works exactly in this way, and the `system` message for ChatGPT is something that is hidden from us as users. "
